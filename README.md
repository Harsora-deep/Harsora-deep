👋 Hi, I’m @Harsora-deep

🔧 VLSI | Digital Design | Hardware Engineering

👀 I’m interested in VLSI design, Digital System Design, RTL design, Verification, and Chip-level architectures.

🌱 I’m currently learning Verilog/SystemVerilog, ASIC/FPGA design, Synthesis, and Timing Analysis.

💡 I work on HDL projects, digital circuits, finite state machines, and much more.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on VLSI/FPGA-based projects, RTL design, and hardware–software co-design.
